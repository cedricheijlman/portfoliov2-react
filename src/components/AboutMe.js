          Hello i'm Cedric, 16 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I'm
          currently a Software Development Student at ROC MBO Flevoland.

          skills, firstly started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, after that
          I learned some backend languages to be able to make full-stack MAMP
          applications. 2021 December I started learning the frontend framework
          React and currently also learning the full MERN Stack.
